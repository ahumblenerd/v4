Hello, I am Arun Purushothaman, a software engineer based in Benglauru who enjoys building things that come alive in the internet. I develop exceptional backends with scalability and maintainablity in mind.

Shortly after graduating from [Federal Institute Of Science And Technology](https://fisat.ac.in/), I co founded a startup [Sieve](http://sievehq.com) where I worked on a wide variety of systems from building microfrontends, microserviced backends to CI/CD pipelines and managing AWS infrastructure.
